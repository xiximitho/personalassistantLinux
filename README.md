# Install Depends

you'll need libespeak1 -- in ubuntu/deb: sudo apt install libespeak1 

you'll also need portaudio19-dev -- in ubuntu/deb: sudo apt install portaudio19-dev  (depends on pyaudio)


if you are running for the first time, you need to uncomment the line with function -- criarvoz('Em que posso lhe ser Ãºtil?','pt','util.mp3'). Then the python will create a mp3 file needed.


Actually these are the depends (Maybe will changed)

You need python3.
